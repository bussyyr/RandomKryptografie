Cryptography is the practice and study of techniques for securing communication and information from adversaries.
It encompasses various methods, including encryption, decryption, and authentication.

The Vigenère cipher, named after Blaise de Vigenère, is a method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a simple form of polyalphabetic substitution.
It employs a keyword, where each letter of the keyword refers to a shift in the alphabet.

For example, if the keyword is "KEY", the letter 'K' would shift the plaintext letter by 10 positions, 'E' by 4 positions, and 'Y' by 24 positions.
This method provides a higher level of security compared to simple substitution ciphers, as it uses multiple Caesar ciphers based on the letters of the keyword.

In modern applications, cryptography is essential for securing sensitive data, such as personal information, financial transactions, and confidential communications.
As technology evolves, so do the methods of cryptography, leading to the development of advanced algorithms and protocols that protect data integrity and privacy.

Understanding the principles of cryptography is crucial for anyone interested in cybersecurity, data protection, and information security.
