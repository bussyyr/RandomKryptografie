# Text Encryption Project

## Overview

This project is designed to demonstrate various text encryption methods by reading text from a file and writing the encrypted results to new text files. The encryption methods implemented in this project include:

- **Simple Cryptography with Buffered**: This method provides a straightforward approach to encrypting text using basic techniques. In this method, each letter is assigned a specific character of your choice, allowing for customizable encryption.
- **Caesar Cipher**: The Caesar Cipher is a classic encryption technique that shifts each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of positions down the alphabet.
- **Vigenère Cipher**: The Vigenère Cipher is a more advanced encryption method that uses a keyword to determine the shift for each letter in the plaintext.

## Background

I learned these encryption methods during my Internetkommunikation course. Additionally, I utilized concepts from the Programmieren 2 course, specifically the use of `BufferedReader` and `BufferedWriter`, to efficiently read from and write to text files. This project combines my interest in cryptography and programming, allowing me to explore different encryption techniques in a practical way.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: The programming language used for implementing the encryption methods.
- **BufferedReader**: Used for reading text from files.
- **BufferedWriter**: Used for writing encrypted text to new files.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository:
